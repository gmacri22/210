Web App project for CSC 210
Mario Natalino and Gianna Macri

Target Audience: Students

Purpose: There are many online resources for studying and turning in schoolwork, but it can be difficult to keep track of them. This web app will allow students to save links to these resources in one place and organize them by class. Users will also be able to share links with other users, allowing students to share useful study aids with others in their class or to share resources when collaborating on a group project.
Right now, to store and organize all of these resources, from youtube videos to online readings to sites like webwork and blackboard, you have to either try to remember of all the websites you have accounts for or store the links as bookmarks, but it is difficult to keep track of everything this way and there is no simple way to share the information with others. With our web app students will be able to do both of these things easily.

Meeting the project requirements: The application will allow users to create an account to store and organize their personal resources on the server and read, update, and delete them as desired. It will use Ajax so that they can do this without reloading the entire page.

Beyond the minimum requirements, we want to use Websockets to allow users to communicate with one another in real time.
